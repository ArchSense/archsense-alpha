## Why?

### We make product decisions based on inaccurate knowledge
As a software company, it can be difficult to accurately explain or demonstrate how the product is built.
Therefore we built inaccurate diagrams that represent specific parts of the product and make decisions based on them.
This often leads to miscommunications and unexpected issues that become very costly since they are often discovered too late in the process.

### How are we fixing it?
We are on the path to building a solution that allows any relevant stakeholder (Engineer, Team Leader, Architect, Product Manager or even CTO) to see the live and always up-to-date architecture of their product, get alerts when bad practice is detected and design future solutions based on the real picture.
